        <h1>Fried Chicken Recipe</h1>

        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>
          Fried chicken is an American favorite, especially in the states of the
          Southeastern part of the country. For many Americans, fried chicken is
          an essential for summer celebrations, especially picnics. It'll have
          you licking your fingers whether you enjoy it hot from the skillet and
          cold the next day.
        </p>
        <p>
          The process is pretty straightforward. To start, pieces of chicken are
          soaked in a simple buttermilk brine, which tenderizes the meat and
          makes it extra flavorful. Then the chicken pieces are dredged in
          seasoned flour and fried to crispy perfection in a skillet of hot oil
          or lard.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Chicken, cut into serving pieces &ndash; 3 to 3 1/2 pounds</li>
          <li>Buttermilk &ndash; 2 cups</li>
          <li>Salt &ndash; 1 tablespoon</li>
          <li>Flour &ndash; 2 cups</li>
          <li>Salt &ndash; 1 tablespoon</li>
          <li>Pepper &ndash; 2 teaspoons</li>
          <li>Oil or shortening for deep frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Add the chicken pieces, buttermilk and 1 tablespoon of salt&nbsp;to
            a large, non-reactive bowl. Toss to mix well, cover and refrigerate
            for at least 4 hours, up to 24 hours.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you are ready to start your chicken, remove the bowl from the
            refrigerator and let it come to&nbsp;room temperature for about 20
            to 30 minutes. Don&#39;t try frying chicken pieces when they&#39;re
            cold.&nbsp;The skin won&#39;t&nbsp;get as crispy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the flour, other tablespoon of salt and the pepper to a large
            paper bag. Close the bag and shake it to mix the flour and
            seasonings.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove a piece of chicken from the buttermilk let the excess drip
            off.&nbsp;Add the chicken piece to the bag of flour&nbsp;and repeat
            with a couple more pieces.&nbsp;Roll the top of the bag down and
            shake to coat the pieces well&nbsp;with flour. Remove the coated
            chicken pieces to a baking sheet with a rack and repeat with the
            remaining pieces of chicken. Set the floured chicken aside for about
            20 minutes to set the coating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Heat 1 or 2 inches of oil to 375&deg;F in a large, deep skillet or
            Dutch oven over medium-high flame. Working in batches, place a few
            pieces of chicken into the oil, skin side down,&nbsp;and cook until
            well browned on on side, about 4 to 5&nbsp;minutes. Then flip and
            brown on the other side.&nbsp;Remove to the baking sheet
            and&nbsp;repeat with the remaining chicken.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce the heat to low and return all the chicken to the skillet or
            Dutch oven. Cover and cook slowly for another 30 to 40&nbsp;minutes,
            or until the chicken is cooked through and tender.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the cover and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook for
            another 5 minutes, turning occasionally, to recrisp the skin.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove the chicken to a clean baking sheet and rack&nbsp;and hold in
            a warm oven until serving. Fried chicken goes well with biscuits,
            coleslaw and mashed potatoes. Make up a cream&nbsp;gravy to pour
            over&nbsp;for a true Southern meal.
