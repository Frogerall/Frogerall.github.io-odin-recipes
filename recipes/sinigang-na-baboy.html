    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
      Sinigang is a versatile dish. Pork (baboy), beef (baka), fish (isda),
      chicken (manok) and shrimp (hipon) can all find their way into the pot.
      Likewise, most any vegetable you have on hand can be added to the mix.
      Water spinach, long beans, eggplant and okra are very common.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be honest, most Filipino cooks nowadays use prepackaged sinigang soup
      mix. But if you want to make it like Lola did (that's "Grandma"), then we
      have the recipe for you
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Pork shoulder, cubed -- 2 1/2 to 3 pounds</li>
      <li>Tomatoes, seeded and chopped -- 3 or 4</li>
      <li>Onions, chopped - 1 or 2</li>
      <li>Garlic, chopped -- 3 or 4 cloves</li>
      <li>Fish sauce (<em>patis</em>) -- 1 cup</li>
      <li>Water -- 8 cups</li>
      <li>Tamarind paste -- 1/2 cup</li>
      <li>Boiling water -- 1 cup</li>
      <li>Green chile peppers -- 3 or 4</li>
      <li>Vegetables (see variations) -- about 4 cups</li>
      <li>Salt and pepper -- to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Add the pork, tomatoes, onions, garlic and fish sauce to a large pot.
        Place the pot over medium-high flame and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to
        medium and cook for about 10 minutes to reduce the liquid a bit. (You
        may want to open a window. Fish sauce does have a smell.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the water and bring back to a boil over medium-high heat. Skim off
        any scum that rises to the surface, and then reduce heat to low, cover
        and simmer until the pork is tender, an hour to an hour and a half.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the tamarind paste into a heat-proof bowl and pour the boiling
        water over it. Let set for 5 to 10 minutes, then mash the pulp with
        clean fingers to mix the tamarind and water well. Strain through a sieve
        and discard the fibers and seeds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir the tamarind water into the simmering pot, cover again and simmer
        for about 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add your desired vegetables to the pot and press them down into the
        simmering liquid. Cover and simmer until the vegetables are cooked
        through but still firm, another 10 to 20 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot in bowls accompanied by steamed rice.</li>
    </ol>
